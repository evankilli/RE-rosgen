title: Replication of Rosgen Stream Classification Analysis
---

## Background

This analysis is a replication of two analyses. [The original, performed by David Rosgen](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0341816294900019), took information from studies of multiple river systems to devise a classification scheme based on a number of factors, including the width of the valley and of the river when full, slope, and even particle size of material (e.g. pebbles, sand) on the riverbed. The second was [a study conducted by Alan Kasprak, et. al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150293), which applied Rosgen's framework to Oregon's John Day River.

In conducting this analysis, students like myself were assigned points from Kasprak's study at random to study. Through open source GIS and analytical tools like R/RStudio and GRASS GIS, we attempted to use data from the [Columbia Habitat Monitoring Program](https://www.champmonitoring.org/) - a project aiming to generate a standard set of fish habitat monitoring methods in and around the Columbia River, LIDAR DEMs at 1m resolution, and models developed from these data to gather sufficient data for analysis.

## Sampling Plan and Data Description

As stated earlier, each student conducting this analysis was assigned a data point from Kasprak's analysis in the CHaMPs data. My designated location was at loc_id=4
